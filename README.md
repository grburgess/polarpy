# polarpy
The gamma-ray polarimeter POLAR on board the Chinese space-station observed gamma-rays from 80-600 keV and collected both spectral and polarization data from a variety of astrophysical objects including gamma-ray bursts.

This suite of tools allows for the reduction, and analysis of the data in the 3ML framework. 

The RAW POLAR data are in ROOT format. This package provides conversion tools to create data in HDF5 format.
