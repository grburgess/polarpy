# polarpy
The gamma-ray polarimeter POLAR on board the Chinese space-station observed gamma-rays from XXX-XXX keV and collected both spectral and polarization data from a variety of astrophysical objects including gamma-ray bursts.

This suite of tools allows for the reduction, and analysis of the data in the 3ML framework.
